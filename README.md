# Tkinter Playground

A small experimental project where I explored Python's Tkinter GUI library. This repository contains a simple Tkinter app (`tkinter.py`), a PyInstaller spec (`tkinter.spec`) and a virtual environment used during development (`myenv/`).

## Contents

- `tkinter.py` — Main Python script for the GUI experiment.
- `tkinter.spec` — PyInstaller spec file generated when creating a bundled executable.
- `myenv/` — Local virtual environment used for development (not recommended to commit in a production repo).

## Overview

This project is a small sandbox for learning and testing Tkinter features (windows, widgets, layout, events). It was used to prototype UI ideas and to create a standalone executable with PyInstaller.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+ (this repo was tested with Python 3.12 in a local `myenv` virtual environment)
- Tk (usually included with standard Python from system packages on Linux)
- Optional: PyInstaller (to build a standalone executable)

## Quickstart — run locally

1. (Optional) Activate the included virtual environment:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

2. Run the app:

```bash
python tkinter.py
```

If you don't use the included `myenv`, create a fresh virtual environment instead:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you add one
python tkinter.py
```

## Building a standalone executable

This project includes a `tkinter.spec` file generated by PyInstaller. To build an executable (one-file):

```bash
# install pyinstaller if you don't have it
pip install pyinstaller

# build using the included spec
pyinstaller tkinter.spec

# or generate a one-file bundle directly
pyinstaller --onefile tkinter.py
```

The output will appear in the `dist/` directory (PyInstaller creates `build/` and `dist/`). There's also a `build/` folder in this repository from a previous packaging run.

## Project notes

- This repository is intentionally lightweight and experimental.
- The `myenv/` folder is included here for convenience; for cleaner repository hygiene you can remove it and recreate a virtual environment locally.
- If you extend the project, consider adding a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for reproducible installs.

## Troubleshooting

- If the GUI does not appear, ensure you have a working X11/Wayland display (on Linux) and that Tk is installed.
- If importing Tkinter fails, install system packages such as `python3-tk` (Debian/Ubuntu) or the equivalent for your distro.

## Contributing

This is a personal playground — contributions are optional. If you plan to add features, please:

1. Create a new branch
2. Add tests or a short demonstration script for any non-trivial UI behavior
3. Open a PR with a clear description of the change

## License

This repository currently has no license file. If you want to share it publicly, add a `LICENSE` (for example MIT) to clarify reuse rights.

---

If you'd like, I can also:
- add a minimal `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` for dependency management,
- remove or gitignore the `myenv/` directory and add instructions for creating a fresh venv,
- or expand the README with screenshots and a short walkthrough of the UI's features.
